## Overview

The project is available through the demo link above. I learned a lot about how to use Next.js to start a React project, as well as how to use Tailwind to stylize components. Also, I learned more about Axios and how I can use it to send requests to Cloudinary.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

## Features

The user can upload an image by either drag and dropping a file, or by selecting a file through the button. After the image is sent to Cloudinary, the user gets a link to the hosted image.

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
